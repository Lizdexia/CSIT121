  <p> hello! my name is lizzie rosiak, it is a pleasure to meet you in the form of this website! please allow me to introduce myself and share a little of what I enjoy. I love videogames, dungeons and dragons, as well as movies and tv. i do enjoy other things besides this, learning queer history and many more come to mind, however those three are the main ways that I enjoy spending my free time.</p>
