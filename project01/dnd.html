  <p> I absolutely love dungeons and dragons. that kind of interactive story telling really just speaks to me. I cant even remember how long i've been playing it but its been a majority of my life. in fact I have been wrting my very own campaign (worldsetting and story) that i am basing very deeply in eldritch horror. I want it to be a beautifully twisted thriller that the people i play with end up loving.</p>
